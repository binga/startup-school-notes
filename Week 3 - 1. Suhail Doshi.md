How to Measure Your Product
==========================

## Top down approach on metrics

Ask yourself
- Do people really understand my product?
- Do people find it easy to use my product?
- Do people come back to use my product?

- B2B: A lot of your users visit the pricing page. A decent indicator that the user is interested.


### Is it reasy to get started on my product?
- Really think hard about your getting started experience.
- Measure a funnel of the initial UX.
- Measure the speed of doing that valuable thing.

### Tips and Tricks
- Generally, email / text confirmations have enormous dropoffs. They aren't a priority.
- Crucial: Always improve on your initial UX.
- Try: Let users into your product before sign up.
- Shark fin effect. Viral growth followed by death of your product. Once app goes viral, 

- Retention / Reactivation. 

### Ways to measure people coming back:
- DAU / MAU. DAU is a pretty harsh metric - since there are only a few apps that you use everyday.
- B2B: If it's a subscription business, measure revenue churn $. 7% monthly revenue down is equivalent to 58% lost revenue in an year.


### < 0 users?
- Talk to users. Write everything down.
- Talking to users, getting their feedback is way way way better than looking at that one data point or your own intuition.

### Most important metric
- Pick one north star metric. If that number goes down, the company dies.
- Discover why the number is down. Understand why it's moving either ways.
