- 3 things that allowed Siebel's team to survive:
  - Founding team was incredibly technical. Don't get intimidated by any technical challenge.
  - Don't spend a lot of money. Being frugal is wise. gives you ability to screw up and make mistakes.
  - Ego should be highly tied to the startup. Don't work for adding resume points. Treat this as a failure of this idea is failure in life. Don't give up.
- Founders should know why are they solving a problem. What exactly is the problem you are trying to solve? What are we doing? What do we expect the solution to be?
- If someone asks you what you are solving and you find yourself answering the question with an essay, you clearly do not know what you are solving.
- Alright, this is the problem. Who can we help first? Often, founders skip this step. What can we address immediately? How can we get the first indication that this is working.
- Understand who is your customer. Figure out who is your ideal first users. Who is your user and what is the frequency of the problem? Who is getting most value out of your product?
- How intense is the problem? Do the frequency vs intensity analysis. How much are your customers willing to pay? Start at a price rather than 0. Almost always.
- If your customers are hard to find, spend time reaching / talking to them first.

- Does your MVP actually solve your problem? Gut check yourself to see if you are solving the problem. If your MVP takes more time, you are drifting from your original idea. One hack: give your product to your users.
- Which users should you go after first? It's your MVP - you have made something bad - who are the most desperate customers who are willing to use your bad product?
- Setup metrics pipeline - Google Analytics? - No!!! mixpanel, amplitude, heap - are more comprehensive. Make measurement a part of your product spec.
### Product Dev Cycle - v1
- Write down the spec. Write. Write. It's important. Avoid long dev cycles.
- Define a metric. For paying customers - this should always be revenue. No bullshit. For others, it's DAU or a usage metric. Brainstorm - everyone's idea should be on the board. Everyone should have mixpanel open. 
- Easy / medium / hard. Hard stuff plus useless stuff should be avoided. If an idea is hard and if it doesn't move the needle, chuck it. Define it.
- Write the damn spec. What are those features? Why are these needed? How do they move the numbers?

### Pivot vs Iterate
- What impressive thing took only two months to build?
- Think of the first iPhone. It was dumb! It didn't have 3G, no app store, screen broke too often. However, Steve iterated. MVP can actually suck. However, launch it fast and iterate!

- In the end, Michael says he replies to all emails. No kidding. Hmm, I'm going to write to him to seek advice. Stay tuned!
